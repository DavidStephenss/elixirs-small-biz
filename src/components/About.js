        Hello! This part of our website is a just a bit of why I created elixirs and what it can be used for. 
        <br/>
        Elixirs Was created to put all your favorite cocktails in one place. I was a bartender at alamo Drafthouse for several years and while working there I learned so much about cocktails. 
        <br/>
        When I was eventually furloughed this year I realized not a lot of people have any idea how to make or much about the vast library of classic cocktails.
        <br/>
         It was my love for cocktails and my new found love for programming that drew me to make this app. This app will have the ability to let you pick and choose your favorite cocktails and create some of your own. 
         <br/>
         Thanks for visiting! I hope you enjoy!
